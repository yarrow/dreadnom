This folder contains the Markdown files from your copy of the amazing _Dread {nomicon}_ by [Raging Swan Press](https://www.ragingswanpress.com/). They've been adjusted for use in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) with the [Dice Roller](https://plugins.javalent.com/Dice+Roller/Dice+Roller) and [Force Note View Mode](https://github.com/bwydoogh/obsidian-force-view-mode-of-note) plugins.

Each note in this folder each originally contained the line:

> {thank_you}

## Dice Roller plugin

These notes work with the [Dice Roller](https://plugins.javalent.com/Dice+Roller/Dice+Roller) plugin, which inserts dice rolls before all the random tables in the book. If you don't have it installed, you can still see the tables, but you won't be able to roll dice directly from the note.

## Force Note View Mode plugin

When you install the [Force Note View Mode](https://github.com/bwydoogh/obsidian-force-view-mode-of-note) plugin, you'll see these notes in preview mode (rather than editing mode). If you see a line saying `obsidianUIMode  preview` at the beginning of each note, you can hide them by going to Obsidian's settings, then `Editor`, and changing `Properties in document` to `Hidden`.
