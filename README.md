The _[Dread Thingonomicon](https://www.ragingswanpress.com/system-neutral/the-dread-thingonomicon)_ and _[Dread Laironomicon](https://www.ragingswanpress.com/system-neutral/dread-laironomicon)_ books from [Raging Swan Press](https://www.ragingswanpress.com/) have hundreds of random tables. If you've purchased one of these books, the `dreadnom` command allows you to adjust the Markdown files distributed with it for use in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), where you can select a random entry from any table with the click of the mouse. (Requires the [Dice Roller](https://plugins.javalent.com/Dice+Roller/Dice+Roller) Obsidian plugin.)

Examples:

- `dreadnom DT_TextFiles.zip MyObsidianVault/Thingonomicon`
  - Creates the `Thingonomicom` folder in `MyObsidianVault` and populates it with the notes in `DT_TextFiles.zip`. Every random table in the notes will have one item, chosen randomly, displayed in bold immediately at the head of the table. Click on the bold item to switch to chose another item at random.
- `dreadnom Dread_Laironomicon_Text_Archive.zip MyObsidianVault/Laironomicon`
  - As above but for the Laironomicon.
