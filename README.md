The *[Dread Thingonomicon](https://www.ragingswanpress.com/system-neutral/the-dread-thingonomicon)* and *[Dread Laironomicon](https://www.ragingswanpress.com/system-neutral/dread-laironomicon)* books from [Raging Swan Press](https://www.ragingswanpress.com/) have hundreds of random tables. The `dreadnom` command allows you to adjust the Markdown files distributed with each book so you that can select a random entry from any table with the click of a mouse, when you use Obsidian and the Dice Roller plugin.
