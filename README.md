The _[Dread Thingonomicon](https://www.ragingswanpress.com/system-neutral/the-dread-thingonomicon)_ and _[Dread Laironomicon](https://www.ragingswanpress.com/system-neutral/dread-laironomicon)_ books from [Raging Swan Press](https://www.ragingswanpress.com/) have hundreds of random tables. The `dreadnom` command allows you to adjust the Markdown files distributed with each book so you that can select a random entry from any table with the click of a mouse, when you use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and the [Dice Roller](https://plugins.javalent.com/Dice+Roller/Dice+Roller) plugin.

Examples:

- `dreadnom DT_TextFiles.zip MyObsidianVault/Thingonomicon`  
  Creates the `Thingonomicom` folder in `MyObsidianVault` and populates it with the notes in `DT_TextFiles.zip`. Every random table in the notes will have one item, chosen randomly, displayed in bold immediately at the head of the table. Click on the bold item to switch to chose another item at random.
- `dreadnom Dread_Laironomicon_Text_Archive.zip MyObsidianVault/Laironomicon`  
  As above but for the Laironomicon.
